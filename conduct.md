## The full version

### Preamble

This document defines the Code of Conduct of the global PHP Group and all of
its environments. You **accept** the rules outlined by the Code of Conduct
**when joining** our group or **when participating** in any of our
repositories. You **must** follow the Code of Conduct accordingly.
**Any violation** will result in the temporary or permanent removal of your
membership. The Code of Conduct counts for everyone, administrators and regular
members alike.

The following rules are **mandatory** to participate in the group and any of
its repositories:

### Content localization

Anything published on the timeline of the group must be in **English**. Members
of the group are located all over the world. The language of the group has been
standardized to English to guarantee painless communication. Attached
shares localized into other languages will be removed without further notice.
Posted content that is localized in other languages and that does not count as
a regular Facebook share will be removed.

Commits and issues sent to our repositories must be localized to **English**.

### Content quality

Shares and posts to the timeline **must have a regular level of quality**.
Questions **must be researched** before being posted. The group acts as a group
to help on specific problems, not to read out documentations or querying the
web for you. You must **avoid posting large code snippets** to the timeline of
the group. We always recommend to share source code using
[nopaste service](https://php.earth/doc/interop/nopaste) to grant the best
possible readability. Long source code posted to the timeline can be difficult
to read, because of the limited space on Facebook. Topics with large source
code as their content will be removed from the timeline of the group. Comments
with large source code as their content will be removed from the content stream.
Duplicate topics are not encouraged as they fill the group timeline and hinder
the visibility of other topics. Duplicates will be removed from the
group timeline.

There is no place for low-quality content. Low-quality content includes topics
with only code and *without any proper description of the problem*, unclear
photos of screens that are difficult to read, and job opportunity shares that
don't have a proper introduction.

### Forbidden content

It is not allowed to post content that does not cover PHP and web-centric
development. Any violation of this rule will result in permanent removal of
membership. Content that violates the Facebook community standards will be
forwarded to Facebook staff.

**Job opportunities** must be related to PHP or web development! Use some
discretion in the frequency of such posts, and do not post them every day or
every hour. Our group is aimed primarily at discussions and should not act as a
job feed. Any off-topic opportunities will be removed. Job opportunities that
encourage discrimination as outlined below under "Social Behavior" are not
acceptable and will be removed.

Humor and sarcasm are not encouraged because they can have different points of
reference among users.

Sharing or requesting for personal data (emails, phone numbers, WhatsApp numbers,
Skype identities or addresses in general) are explicitly not allowed in the group.
Instead you should use private message functionality. This excludes sharing your
contact information used for business purposes.

**Hijacking topics** is not allowed. This either includes off-topic
advertisements in comments or commenting in a way that should be done by
starting a new conversation.

Exploits and hacks are not allowed.

You must respect licenses and other people's work. To use other people's code,
text, themes, designs and similar intellectual property, please consult with
the owners and the given licenses. Reports to the original authors will be also
made for further investigation based on the harm done. **Copyright
infringements** end with a permanent removal of the offending membership
and all related offending material.

Committing any kind of the described forbidden content to our repository will
be rejected and your behavior will be alerted to the GitHub staff.

Security issues are examined and treated accordingly to the severity of the
situation. If the issue is severe, the topic is removed from the public
discussion to prevent further possible damage. Project owners are notified
about it and are given time to fix it.

### Social behavior

**You have to act social**. There is no place for harassment or bullying at our
group, nor any place for political content not related to PHP or web
development. You should never compromise or harm other members.

**Discrimination is not acceptable**. Discrimination on the basis of race,
gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, nationality, religion,
technology and any other arbitrary exclusion of a group of people is unwelcome.
The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances is not acceptable.

**You have to act peaceful**. There is no place for terrorism, recruitment
shares and social honeypots. We actively track group content and will forward
such content directly to Facebook and **international authorities**. Our main
duty is to **protect our members**.

**Handle your posts accordingly to the situation**. Don't delete your topics
once solutions were provided. Respect time of others willing to help you.
Leaving topics available in the group might also help someone as you in the
future. Topics are also visible in group search and therefore available for
people looking for existing solutions.

**Closing topics**. Topics are closed by group staff decision in a case of
non-English content, personal data shared, duplicate posts or low-quality
discussions. Closing topics on your behalf is not a welcome practice and
requires a decision from the group staff. Instead, ask staff members to close
the particular topic for you.

**Bumping topics**. Bumping topics in order to change the post position above
the other discussions is not a welcome practice and should be avoided except for
posts related to support (questions) that need additional attention and help
from community members.

**Affiliate links and paid promotions**: When a post contains an affiliate link
or a paid promotion, it must be clear to users by adding additional information
like "this is an affiliate link/paid promotion" or similar in the post
description.

**Private messaging**. Avoid sending commercial, support questions, or similar
messages to community members over private messages. Harassing community members
should be avoided at all costs. Contact and interact with people you don't know
with some sense related to particular situation and respect user's privacy.

### Disrespecting staff members

Insults, not following the instructions and similar disrespecting of the group
administrators and moderators will result in a permanent ban.

Blocking staff members makes communication with you impossible. We must be able
to communicate with you to resolve issues, explain certain situations, and to
give you further instruction about posts. In such cases, other staff members
may ask you to remove the block, otherwise your membership ends in a permanent
ban.

### Ban

When banning (blocking/removing/revoking account membership), the following
types of bans are practiced:

* Kick

  A user account is only removed from the group and not blocked. They may
  return to the group at any time.

* Temporary ban

  A user account is blocked from accessing the group for few days or weeks.
  When a group staff member removes the user from the blocked list, the user
  may return.

* Ban

  A user account is blocked from accessing the group for few months to about a
  year.

### Contact

The project team maintains confidentiality with regards to the reporter of an
incident. Wherever possible, we ask you to not disclose information about the
incident publicly until we properly address the situation. This includes not
posting on social media about the incident until we have had an opportunity to
ensure the safety of all involved. Code of conduct violations may be reported
by contacting the project team at `conduct AT php.earth`.
